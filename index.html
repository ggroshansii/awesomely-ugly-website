                        <h2>Jerry</h2>
                        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRO7SVTTAQanFDI-fNLUqXidVh6L89OGqZhfVpptiD8OIq9XAdItCI5lIKyieztnfGx-RI&usqp=CAU"
                            alt="">
                        <p>Jerry is the character that glues the show together. He is the observant to all of the
                            ridiculous things that happen between the other main characters, often using his trademark
                            observational jokes in the process. He does not seem to have much emotion throughout the
                            show Elaine points out that he has "never felt remorse," to which Jerry replies, "Yeah, I
                            feel kinda bad about that." Jerry, George and Elaine all share a general trait of not
                            letting go of other character's remarks and going to great lengths to be proven right. In
                            one episode, Jerry goes out of his way to rent a house in Tuscany, Italy, just because "The
                            Maestro" told him there weren't any available. He is maybe the least exciting character in a
                            way, but an interesting aspect he brings is his relationships. He almost has a new
                            relationship every episode always finding a small flaw that causes him to break up with each
                            woman.</p>

                    <article class="george" id='george'>
                        <h2>George</h2>
                        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/6d0c5fc5b65848a9a6b0d3b0c3bbff5b/tenor.png" alt="">

                        <p>George is neurotic, self-loathing, and not intelligent. He is constantly scheming to try to
                            get out of work whether it is reading a book or having people bother him at his office. He
                            has went to a strangers house to watch Breakfast at Tiffany's, (a 90 page book) he has acted
                            frustrated anytime anyone saw him at work to make people think he was really busy, and he
                            has even slept under his desk for extended periods of time. Though George is displayed as a
                            generally unintelligent man, in one episode he is forced to be abstinent because his
                            girlfriend has mono. This leads him to access a whole new part of his brain that is no
                            longer focused on sex. During this time he learns a new language in a day, coaches Yankee
                            players on their swing, and many other feats that ordinary George would not be capable of.
                            He brings a certain charm to the show that no other character brings, maybe it is his
                            constant agony that brings all of us the joy we get from watching George.</p>

                    <article class='elaine' id='elaine'>
                        <h2>Elaine</h2>
                        <img src="https://www.seinfeldscripts.com/images/elaine1.jpg" alt="">

                        <p>Elaine is intelligent and assertive. She claims that she has gotten a 140 on an IQ test and
                            takes one for George because he wanted his girlfriend to think that he was smart,
                            unfortunately she got very stressed and angry resulting in a 90 on the test. Elaine has also
                            thrown Georges toupee out Jerry’s window yelling about how she hates it. Another trait of
                            Elaine’s is her superficiality, cited by this incident, After a rock climbing accident
                            mangles Tony's face, Elaine admits to Jerry that she can't date someone who isn't attractive
                            and wonders how long she is obligated to stay with him post-accident. She is the only real
                            main female character showing up in almost every episode. She adds a necessary feminine side
                            to the group.</p>

                        <p>Kramer is a one of a kind character he is eccentric, goofy, a wannabe entrepreneur, and many
                            other things. A few examples of his entrepreneurial pursuits are the pizza place where you
                            make your own pie, the bro, (a bra for a guy) and a cologne that smells like the ocean which
                            the idea is actually stolen by Calvin Klein much to the dismay of Kramer. Another
                            characteristic that Kramer is known for is his odd body movements and sudden outbursts such
                            as saying “Yo Yo Ma” randomly. He is known to mooch off of his friends constantly, mostly
                            from Jerry’s kitchen. Kramer brings an aspect of unpredictability and also gets his friends
                            into trouble by convincing them of doing illegal things such as urinating in a parking
                            garage and parking in a handicap spot. Combine all of these things and you have a character
                            that can be labeled a “fan favorite.”</p>

                        <p>Whether Jerry is on the phone, his friends are visiting him, or he and Kramer are chatting
                            about something hilarious, it's hard to think of a Seinfeld episode that doesn't include
                            this set. Viewers learned so much about this character from the way that he has set up his
                            apartment, as his love of cereal is on display in the kitchen, and he has very simple
                            furniture. This is the place where Jerry becomes closer with Kramer, invites dates over, and
                            wonders if he and Elaine should be more than friends again.</p>

                        <p>The gang always meets her to grab a meal, have some coffee, and chat about what's going on in
                            their lives. They have some hilarious and seemingly meaningless conversations here, and it's
                            a good place to observe their friendship dynamic and the fact that Seinfeld is a "show about
                            nothing." If Jerry isn't home, there's a good chance that he's here.</p>

                        <img src="https://i.redd.it/bux83234kga01.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>Kramer's apartment is as quirky as he is with pasta figures near the couch and many strange
                            objects that the other characters wouldn't have in their homes. This is the third most
                            significant location on Seinfeld. Since Kramer lives so close to Jerry, he's often part of
                            the action, and viewers get to see his goofy world regularly. Chances are that even when
                            Jerry is having a boring day at home, Kramer is up to something interesting.</p>

                            show, as it's where George spends much of his time. Viewers are familiar with seeing the
                            family fighting here, as they don't seem to have conversations that don't involve screaming
                            and tension, and it's where George examines the state of his life, wishing that things were
                            going much better for him.</p>

                        <p>While Seinfeld's NYC depiction isn't perfect, the show does offer a glimpse of the daily life
                            of a few New Yorkers. The streets of New York City are definitely a major setting on the
                            sitcom, as the characters are often walking around and finding themselves in hilarious,
                            silly situations. They often run into people who they know, which can be awkward since they
                            don't love everyone. The characters also get stuck on the subway in one memorable episode,
                            making this a major setting, too. If not for the other important locations, this would be
                            ranked much higher.</p>
